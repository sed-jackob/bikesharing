# Analysis Overview

The objective of this analysis is to convince investors that a ***bike-sharing*** program in *Des Moines* is a solid business proposal.

In this analysis, I will analyze a similar ***bike-sharing*** program in *NYC*:

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
4. Top starting locations
5. A visual to easily identify which bikes are due for repairs
